                            ++Marie Curie devoted her whole life to science, brave and impartial.

                        <p>
                            + For many people today, accessing higher education is often not too difficult. But for Marie, that time was a huge, persistent effort.

                        <p>
                            +In addition to successfully isolating the radioactive substance radium, the Curies also demonstrated its role in inhibiting cancer cells, and with the successful isolation of this substance, In addition to helping to overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, Curie's work had a profound impact on the social sphere. To achieve her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, both in her homeland and in her adopted country, placed in her path because she was a woman.

                        <p>
                            +During World War I, she researched and purchased X-ray equipment, mobile X-ray cars and auxiliary generators to treat wounded soldiers right on the battlefield. These machines were powered by Radium gas, a colorless radioactive gas emitted by radium, later recognized as radon, to sterilize infected tissue. She became the director of the Red Cross X-ray service and founded the first French Military X-ray Center. You see, all of her inventions were donated to science in general, or to save lives, not used for personal gain. That is what made her a great person honored by the whole world. Her image was honored to be printed on the Polish Zloty and the French franc. To honor her and her husband, scientists took the 96th element in the periodic table, Curium, symbol Cm, to honor her and Pierre.

                        <p>
                            +She was known for her honesty and moderation. After receiving a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning a living. She gave most of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie deliberately chose not to patent her process for isolating radium so that the scientific community could work unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to scientific organizations with which she was affiliated rather than to herself. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein is said to have remarked that she was perhaps the only person who could not be bribed by fame.

                        <p>
                            +You may not know that Pitchblende is a complex mineral, and chemical separation of its components is an arduous task. Moreover, the radium contained in the ore is extremely small, accounting for about 1/10g Radi in a new raw ore. So to successfully separate radio radioactive substances, the couple must filter and do countless experiments. Exactly the number of up to thousands of repetitive experiments during 4 years, in difficult conditions, poor labs, do not have enough specialized tools and both have to teach to teach Sword livelihood. They finally successfully separated radi radioactive substances and along with radi research for cancer treatment. Couple received the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.

                            +Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money. She said:
                            <blockquote style={{ background: '#baba99' }}>

                                "I am going to give up the little gold I possess. I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost."

                            </blockquote>
                            She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause. After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).
