Marie Curie is a physicist, Balan -original French chemist. She was a woman who impressed the world with discoveries that opened up new foundations in physics and chemistry, and also opened the door for advances in techniques, biology and medicine. learn. She was also the one who created a new platform for women in the field of science by becoming the first woman to receive a PhD scientist in France, the first woman to present in Solvbon and especially her.

Her parents are a teacher. Her mother, Bronislawa Sktodowska, is the principal of a boarding school reputation for women. Her father, Wladyslaw Sklodowski, teaches physics and mathematics about her balan heritage. As a result of patriotism, Russian supervisors forced him to be in a lower salary. He also lost his savings because of a bad investment. To raise 5 children, they have to accept boarding students. This will cause death. Maria's eldest siblings, her sister Zofia, suffered from a fever from one of the people who stayed in and died. A few years later, when Maria was 10, her mother died of tuberculosis. The tragedies have led Maria to abandon the Catholicism- the faith of her mother- and become you in the impossible theory. Her father will not forgive himself for losing his family's savings. However, his children will remember him as a man who nurtured them in terms of emotion and intelligence. However, Marie Curie did not give up but continued to find ways to continue the higher education path.</p>
