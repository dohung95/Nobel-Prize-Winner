        "text1":"Marie Curie’s research fundamentally changed our understanding of the atom and matter. Before her discoveries, atoms were considered indivisible units of matter. However, her work on radioactivity demonstrated that atoms could spontaneously emit energy, leading to deeper investigations into atomic structure and the development of modern physics.",
        "text2":"Her research directly led to the development of radiation therapy, a critical method for treating cancer. The techniques she pioneered in radium treatment remain foundational in the field of oncology today. By the early 20th century, radium therapy was one of the first systematic approaches to cancer treatment. It involved the insertion of radium needles near or inside tumors to shrink them. This approach evolved into modern radiotherapy, where high-energy radiation (X-rays, gamma rays, or other particles) is directed at tumors from outside the body or through implants.",
        "text3":"Marie Curie became a symbol of women in science. Her two Nobel Prizes broke gender barriers in scientific research, inspiring generations of women to pursue careers in science, even as they continued to face significant obstacles.",
        "text4":"Marie Curie’s legacy is one of perseverance, intellectual brilliance, and a lasting impact on both science and society. Her two Nobel Prizes reflect not only her personal achievements but also her broader influence on the future of scientific inquiry.",
